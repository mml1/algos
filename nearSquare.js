/*
	You're given a positive integer n. 
	Your task is to represent this number as a product of two positive integers a and b, 
	such that a * b = n, a â‰¤ b, and the difference b - a is the smallest possible.

	Return the answer as an array of two elements [a, b].

	Example:
	For n = 10, the output should be
	Near_Square(n) = [2, 5].

	It's possible to write 10 in two ways: 2 * 5 = 10, 
	or 1 * 10 = 10. The 2 * 5 = 10 representation has 
	the smallest difference (b - a = 5 - 2 = 3), so the answer is [2, 5].
